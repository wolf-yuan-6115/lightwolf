## 10/21/2025 - Drew the schematic  

Drew the schematic, read whole bunch of datasheets.

I ultimately decided to use RP2350, with a 8 MB SPI flash, along with high technology... USB-C connector.

There will also be some pins header on the board.

## 10/22/2025 12 AM - Partially routed PCB  

Got some routing on the PCB now!

Currently only placed main MCU on the board and pin header, other thing is still waiting to do.

I'm concerned about the very limited board size... Hope everything will fit inside the Raspberry Pi Pico size

## 10/22/2025 11:03 PM - Routed non GPIO part on PCB  

Ayyyy some great progress... though there's a bigger challenge upcoming.

I routed all non GPIO pins to RP2350! This leaves me with a bunch of GPIOs. I hope I could route them without getting myself crazy.

## 10/22/2025 11:25 PM - Changed to 4 layer board  

2 layer board made by routing a lotttt messy, soo I decided to change my board to a 4 layer board.

After switching, I don't need to deal with 3V3 and 1V1 plane anymore, yayy

## 10/23/2025 12 AM - Thing didn't go as expected  

After changing the board to a 4 layer one, I don't think I did a great job at trace management...

The board now looks even more messy, I think I need to redo the whole wring someday.

## 10/23/2025 9 PM - Finished rerouting the PCB!  

Yayyy, finally finished rerouting the PCB with 4 layers board!

The inner layer now acts like 3V3 and 5V pane, it heavily reduced the complexity of my route. I think current one is good to ship... just one thing left...

Time for silkscreen art!

> Sadly Hackatime wasn't up during these hours. I tried my best to remember to run it when I start KiCad
  

## 10/23/2025 11 PM - Finished cooking silkscreen art  

I think I finished my silkscreen art! Though I didn't find a great way to automate the process of labeling GPIO pins, I just adjust and change them manually.
