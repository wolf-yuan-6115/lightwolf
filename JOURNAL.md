## 10/21/2025 - Drew the schematic  

Drew the schematic, read whole bunch of datasheets.

I ultimately decided to use RP2350, with a 8 MB SPI flash, along with high technology... USB-C connector.

There will also be some pins header on the board.

## 10/22/2025 - Partially routed PCB  

Got some routing on the PCB now!

Currently only placed main MCU on the board and pin header, other thing is still waiting to do.

I'm concerned about the very limited board size... Hope everything will fit inside the Raspberry Pi Pico size
